title: What are your “favorite” R mistakes?
---

R is great, but it’s also weird. R was built by and for statisticians, so it’s not like other programming languages. Its idiocracies can be a source of deep frustration for beginners. But I’d argue there is no better tool for data analysis.

That’s why I’m writing a short e-book *How To Make Mistakes In R* for O’Reilly. It’s modelled after the excellent [**How To Make Mistakes In Python**](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/how-to-make-mistakes-in-python.csp), by [Mike Pirnat](http://mike.pirnat.com/). The target audience is all R coders, from those just starting out all the way to the advanced developers. It’ll cover mistakes in set-up, style, and statistics -- and other surprises, too. I’m especially qualified to write this book because I’ve made many, many mistakes in R  in my own work.

I’m excited about this project! But I need your help. **What are your “favorite” R mistakes?**

Here are a few examples of mistakes I plan to address, but I’m looking for ally types -- ranging from the dead-simple, beginner-level screwups to the subtle, advanced bugs you’ve encountered:
* Function masking (e.g., dplyr and plyr) and how to fix it
* Repeatedly typing `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`
* Liberal use of piping (%>%) to improve code readability
* How the default `table()` function masks NA values
* Using the `broom` package to standardize the output of statistical models
* Not using GitHub and/or RStudio Projects for collaboration

Send them to me, via [email](mailto:andrew.w.flowers@gmail.com), a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/andrewflowers) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewflowers). The more the merrier. Feel free to contact me multiple times, as you recall your “favorite” R mistakes.
